        For the navigation system, we plan to use a CD/CI Machine learning
        algorithm, and will look at building upon an existing drone control
        model to avoid reinventing the wheel. We will be testing and training
        the program extensively in India, as we have easy access to makerspaces
        and resources over there. As we continue running our drones, the
        algorithm will only get more accurate and safer, as they will be
        constantly running. <br><br> Similarly, we will constantly update our data on the
        demographics as soon as updated information comes out, and look at
        sending out new surveys on an annual basis.
