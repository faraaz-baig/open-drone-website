        We are building a drone system that does not require any infrastructure,
        allowing us to implement this in remote areas, bringing down delivery
        times from hours to minutes. Drone delivery is something that has been
        worked on for a long time, but governments have only recently allowed
        drone systems to operate commercially. What sets us apart is that we're
        building a service for those who are not large enough to do business
        with the giants in the space. Instead of building warehouses and large
        centers, we're focused on only bringing what is necessary - the drone
        itself, so that anyone can use delivery, even those in the most remote
        areas.
