        Although we're going up against multimillion dollar companies, our team
        has a global perspective in mind. The likes of Amazon and Google have
        been spending years developing their drone delivery service, and it will
        take some years until they have a drone fleet delivering supplies to all
        parts of the United Stated. But what about the rest of the world. It
        would easily be decades before such technology comes into the hands of
        even relatively prominent places like India. <br><br> Coming from various parts
        of the world, our design team is building a product with a global
        purpose from the very beginning. By creating an open source hardware,
        we're allowing places like India to begin their own drone delivery
        services not in decades, not in a couple of years, but right now. This
        kind of model simply doesn't seem like a reasonable option for tech
        giants with the manpower, but this allows us to reach all parts of the
        world at once <br><br> This isn't just idealistic thinking though. There are
        incredible successes that came about from open-source, like Linux and
        Arduino, which have completely shaped their respecive industries. Even
        less publicized projects, such as the M19 initiative and Dev4X have
        intellegently used open source hardware to create projects in months
        which would normally take a well-funded team years to complete. Right
        now, millions of people are looking for ways to help out in these trying
        times. We're part of that movement, and we want to use that movement.
