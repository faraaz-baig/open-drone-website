        Although we're going up against multimillion dollar companies, our team
        has a global perspective in mind. The likes of Amazon and Google have
        been spending years developing their drone delivery service, and it will
        take some years until they have a drone fleet delivering supplies to all
        parts of the United Stated. But what about the rest of the world. It
        would easily be decades before such technology comes into the hands of
        even relatively prominent places like India. <br /><br />
        Coming from various parts of the world, our design team is building a
        product with a global purpose from the very beginning. By creating an
        open source hardware, we're allowing places like India to begin their
        own drone delivery services not in decades, not in a couple of years,
        but right now. This kind of model simply doesn't seem like a reasonable
        option for tech giants with the manpower, but this allows us to reach
        all parts of the world at once <br /><br />
        This isn't just idealistic thinking though. There are incredible
        successes that came about from open-source, like Linux and Arduino,
        which have completely shaped their respecive industries. Even less
        publicized projects, such as the M19 initiative and Dev4X have
        intellegently used open source hardware to create projects in months
        which would normally take a well-funded team years to complete. Right
        now, millions of people are looking for ways to help out in these trying
        times. We're part of that movement, and we want to use that movement.
